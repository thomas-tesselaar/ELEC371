First two stages of execution are provided below.
1. Mem. address <- [PC], read mem., IR <- mem. data, PC <- [PC] + 1
2. Decode instr., RA <- [Rs], RB <- [Rt], prepare immediate value (based on decode)


Prepare RTN descriptions for the three stages after fetch/decode for Load Rt,X(Rs).
3. RZ <- [RA] + X
4. Mem. address <- RZ, read mem. RY <- mem. data
5. Rt <- [RY]

Prepare RTN descriptions for the three stages after fetch/decode for Add Rd, Rs, Rt.
3. RZ <- [RA] + [RB]
4. RY <- [RZ]
5. Rd <- [RY]

Write combinational logic expressions for the control signals that are listed below.
RF_Write = T5 * (Load + ALU + Call)
Mem_Read = T1 + T4 * (Load)
IR_enable = T1
